# This repository is used to store my project for my course "Introduction to bioinformatics" at spring, 2021.

## Why I write this
Actually, it has been a long time for me to make a personal index for myself. I want to do so for several reasons:
1. It's a perfect way for others to know about me. Sometimes they just know me from daily life, but it's not all. I suppose I'm far more humorous than you think.
2. Life is not how many days you live, but how much you remember of spent days. I don't want my days to go in a hurry and leave everything I have done behind. Write them somewhere is a great way to memorize. By the day Minghao is so old, he would review his life and feel so pleased that there are still so many things to recall. That's will a great fortune.
3. In the best years of my life, I have done lots of things and projects. Experimental researches, medical courses, statistics courses, psychology, AI(machine learning, deep learning),bioinformatics(transcriptomics, proteomics, phylogenetic analysis, biological database usage...) and a little philosophy. I still love what I'm doing, and I will be glad to beat them in my heart.
4. Github is a safe habourï¼Œright? I won't lost my data if my laptop is broken by my Huskie (/doge).
5. Writing is good for you. We get a lot of information everyday so it's really important for us to have enough time to review, summary and organize them by my own words.
6. A good chance to express your feelings, knowledge, skills...right?
7. And more...

## Notes
I put my index files at "gh-pages" branch. "index.html" is the main file to call other materials. I first make my materials in my windows10 and then put them all into my github repository (artanis-tera/github.io). Remember that don't put many things in the repository at once. 


***Remember: your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.***
